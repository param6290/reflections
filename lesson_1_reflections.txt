How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It saves alot of time.
Specially if the file size is big.
Then eaily required changes can be done.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long?
It will make it easy to look back the previous code,
if the current changes are not working properly.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
pros-- we have a logical idea of the right time to commit the code.
 as we  are aware of the type of changes we did.

cons - smtyms we may make mistakes as it is a manaul approach.
which perhaps google docs is less likely to do so.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Becaue when files are interrelated like css and html. The chnages in one file
will reflect on others.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log i can use to see the commit ids
and using tat id i can use git diff to find the diff bet versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Because now i know, even if some thing wrong gets committed anytime i can 
revert back to the previous changes.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want to make a project where multiple can work from long distances.
